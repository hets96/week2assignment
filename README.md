# week2assignment

it's been a really challenging assignment for me however the desktop view was fun to make! i've not perfected the iphone view as after inputting the media query, it has given me these white spaces on the bottom and right of the screen. 

I struggle remembering all the javascript codes so when it is mentioned in class i won't know what it is however when i've looked it up or checked my notes it will make sense. 

linking the codes together such as when using the appendChidl(), or in my example the createBigImage(images[picture]) it confuses me, is there a better way to get my head round the meanings?

it would be worth while to have recaps of certain topics especially javascript as it's pretty complicated to understand at first. i don't have any issue with HTML or CSS (i love CSS)
